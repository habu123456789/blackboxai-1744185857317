# YouTube Clone

## Project Overview
YouTube Clone is a web application that mimics the look and functionality of YouTube. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it showcases a responsive design with a sidebar for navigation and a grid layout to display video cards. The application utilizes Tailwind CSS for styling and Font Awesome for iconography, providing a modern user interface.

## Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/youtube-clone.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd youtube-clone
   ```

3. Open `index.html` in your preferred web browser to view the project.

## Usage
Once you have the project running in your browser, you can interact with the interface as you would on YouTube. The application features a search bar, a sidebar for navigation, and a grid of video thumbnails that display video information.

### Note
This is a static implementation and does not include actual video playback or backend functionalities.

## Features
- Responsive layout with a sidebar and video grid
- Search bar for potential future search functionalities
- Icons representing navigation options with Font Awesome
- Modern styling using Tailwind CSS
- Video thumbnails with information like title, views, and upload time

## Dependencies
